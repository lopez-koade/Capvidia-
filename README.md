## Description

This is my first project. 
After having gone through the entire web responsive curriculum of freeCodeCamp, having watched a considerable number of tutorials and made no less amount of challenges from various websites, it's time to put everything that I've learned into practice.
This clone project is not intended to follow the original design by the pixel, but to use it as a general reference keeping the appearance. 

## Objectives

Use Flexbox and Grid
Work with variables
Familiarize with git and github. Stage, commit and push through the console.
Create .classes in css to be reused, keep the code as concise as possible
Keep the exact pattern of the original web page.

## My process

- Html - Determine and write the html structure
- Css - Add reset and variables and style
- Use mobile-first workflow


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
