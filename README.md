## Description

This is my very first project.
After having gone through the entire web responsive curriculum of freeCodeCamp, having watched some tutorials and made challenges from various websites, it's time to put everything that I've learned into practice.
In this project, only html and css will be used, neither Javascript nor other technologies will be implemented. 
It's not intended to follow the original design by the pixel, but to use it as a general reference, keeping the overall appearance. 

## Objectives

Use Flexbox and Grid
Work with variables
Familiarize with git and github. Stage, commit and push through the console. Make and merge branches.
Create .classes to be reused, keep the code as concise as possible.
Keep the exact design of the original web page.

## My process

- Html - Determine and write the html structure
- Css - Add reset, variables and style
- Use mobile-first workflow
- Make it responsive with @media queries


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The importance of making notes through the code to help find sections when needed.
